## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology

This project is an end-to-end demonstration of a data analysis workflow, from cleaning a large dataset to deploying an interactive web application.

- **Data Source:** The project utilizes the [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd), a comprehensive open-source database of over 180,000 terrorist attacks.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - A dedicated preprocessing script was developed to handle the raw 155 MB dataset.
  - **Column Selection:** Out of 135 columns, only 15 relevant columns were selected to optimize performance.
  - **Data Consolidation:** A significant data quality issue was addressed by mapping historical country names (e.g., `West Germany (FRG)`, `Soviet Union`) and non-sovereign territories to their modern equivalents, reducing the unique country count from 205 to a more accurate 184.
  - **Feature Engineering:** A `Casualties` column was created by combining the `Killed` and `Wounded` columns.
- **Visualization & Frontend:**
  - The entire user interface is built with **Streamlit**, a Python framework for building data apps.
  - Interactive charts (line, bar, pie) and the world map are powered by **Plotly Express** for a rich user experience.
- **Deployment:**
  - The application is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, which is connected directly to this GitHub repository for continuous integration.
